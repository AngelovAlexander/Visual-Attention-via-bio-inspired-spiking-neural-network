The Projects create a street attention application and a GUI application supporting its functionality.

Layer.py -> Creating layers that are part of a spiking neural network. If offers methods for creating connections and for plotting data.
ImageToSpikes.py -> Class for creating input spikes from a given picture. It provides functions for visualization and comparison.
Network.py -> The main program of the project. It creates the entire network from an image and specified parameters.
gui.py -> A user interface of ImageToSpike.py and Network.py

spike_statistics.py and network_experiments.py -> Show several experimentations performed on the ImageToSpikes and Network classes.
images -> Stores data sets used for experimentations
statistics -> Stores few of the experiment results.
